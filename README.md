The number of clients on the Internet is constantly increasing. Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are a major driver of these trends. The sheer number of these devices also arouses the interest of potential attackers. The average user is usually not very concerned about the security of mobile apps and therefore they are a popular target. So it is up to the developer to be aware of potential attacks and their effects.

Starting with a simple TODO-App with backend, security measures are iteratively implemented to store and to backup data in an untrusted environment.
